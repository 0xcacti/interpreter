## MonkeyLang Interpreter in Rust

This repo contains an implementation of Thorsten Ball's Monkey Language in Rust, as well 
as some common dev tools for the language.  Specifically, it includes a 
tree-sitter grammar for monkey, a language server protocol (LSP) implementation. 
This all stemmed out of my desire to learn Rust and to learn how 
programming languages work.  Then it snowballed as I got more and more into languages 
and wanting to know how their tooling works.  

# LSP IMPLEMENTATION ON HOLD 

I'm currently working on a few other projects, as per my rules, if I must make a commit
each day.  I didn't today so I made a couple readme commits.
