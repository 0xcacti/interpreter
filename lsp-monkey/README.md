### lsp-monkey

lsp-monkey is an implementation of the LSP protocol both in general 
and for the monkey programming language.  In this project, I define 
all the types and functions needed to implement an LPS server, and 
I do so for monkey.

### TODO 

- [x] Go through all types, using #[serder(rename="")] where needed
- [x] Go through all types, using #[serde(default, skip_serializing_if)] as needed
