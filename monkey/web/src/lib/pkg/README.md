### MonkeyLang Interpreter in Rust

Going through Thorsten Ball's Interpreter Book but implementing it in Rust. 
Still trying to learn Rust.  Please rip me and my implementation apart.


Some of the code here was influenced by [ ThePrimeagen's ](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) version which he abandoned 
two chapters into the book.  Much of the code is influenced by [monkey-wasm](https://github.com/shioyama18/monkey-wasm/tree/master)
